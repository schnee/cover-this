Provided direction for machine learning and data transformation pipelines, and for a robust data warehouse strategy. Achieved massive au‑
tomation of data delivery to end customers (thereby realizing operational inefficiencies). ML efforts included transportation duration models,
scoring of security events, and agent‑based modeling of backhaul opportunities
• Six‑month international assignment in 2022 to build Data Science and Engineering team in Ireland. Collaborated with local recruiters, groups
and universities to build recruitment pipeline and better understand European hiring processes and talent. Resulted in data science and ma‑
chine learning hires in‑country
