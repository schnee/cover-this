        Let's proceed systematically.

        Given the job description and the initial assessment, I'll outline a set of topics for the interview to assess the candidate's technical knowledge in the required skills.

        For instance, if the job demands proficiency in data mining, I'll inquire about topics like "Explain overfitting" or "How does backpropagation work?" If statistical knowledge is essential, questions may revolve around "What is the difference between Type I and Type II error?"

        Ensure there is no repetition of questions, and each question should be distinct.
