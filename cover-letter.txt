In addition to my leadership experience, I have a strong background in data science and familiarity with iterative delivery methodologies. I have hands-on experience in artificial intelligence, machine learning projects, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision (CV). My expertise in these areas, combined with my excellent communication skills, make me an ideal candidate for this role.

Furthermore, I have several years of experience in software engineering, particularly in financial technologies, which roughly aligns with the requirements stated in the job specification.
